# LoneStarExpress
Shuttle Service Website in Austin, Tx

Website was built using a wireframe designed in paint.
a carousel was borrowed from w3 school.
The aim of the website right now is to present services with an option to order a ride using a form.
An emphasis was made on the responsiveness of the page to adapt it to cross end users.
it will be improved to use data from the user using php and more javascript to make it more interactive.
